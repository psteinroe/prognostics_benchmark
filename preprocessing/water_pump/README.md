## water_pump
I have a friend who working in a small team that taking care of water pump of a small area far from big town, there are 7 system failure in last year. Those failure cause huge problem to many people and also lead to some serious living problem of some family. The team can't see any pattern in the data when the system goes down, so they are not sure where to put more attention. Since I believe in using data to solve problem, I ask him to provide available sensor data and hope that someone here can help.
